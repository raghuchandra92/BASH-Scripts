Below i have written an small bash script to download new keys on daily basis to access public servers. This is good for environments
that provides time based access to systems


#!/bin/bash

file=/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa-cert.pub
path=/Users/username/.ssh
if [ -e "$file" ]; then
   echo "file exists"
   echo "removing file now"
   rm $file
else 
   echo "File does not exists"
fi

curl http://<ip>/path/ro/ssh-keys > ~/.ssh/id_rsa_sshca_test-cert.pub
cd $path
 echo "now changing file name and permission of downloaded key"
cat id_rsa_sshca_test-cert.pub >>id_rsa-cert.pub 
chmod 600 id_rsa-cert.pub && rm id_rsa_sshca_test-cert.pub
echo "Good to use new key"
