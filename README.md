# BASH/Shell-Scripts and Linux commands
The purpose of creatin this repo is just to keep track of few concepts which aren't used on daily dasis, but still once in a while you need them and i dont want to waste ,my time googling them. If "you" (any one other than me) are following my repo or updates, please be aware that all these commands or the scripts here may/maynot be working. i will make sure to put only legitimate content here.


And please be aware that these repo's will be most helpful for entry-mid level Linux admins, bec. i am totally aware of struggles faced by begginers, so if you experienced and has strong CMD skills, then this is not the place you should waste your time
