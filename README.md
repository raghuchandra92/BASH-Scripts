# BASH/Shell-Scripts and Linux commands

                                           **************** Welcome ****************

The purpose of creating this repo is to keep track of few concepts which aren't used on daily dasis, but still once in a while you need them and i dont want to waste ,my time googling them. If "you" (any-one other than me) are following my repo or checking it, please be aware that all these commands or the scripts here may/maynot be working. i will make sure to put only legitimate content here. And if you can contribute to this repo it would be great.

If you know any crazy Command line operations or commands, please put them here. Mostly i work on RHEL,CentOS. so commands only compatable will those will be mentioned (And also, i give importance to Ubuntu too).So,commands used in Ubuntu will also be seen here


And please be aware that these repo's will be most helpful for entry-mid level Linux admins, bec. i am totally aware of struggles faced by begginers, so if you experienced and has strong CMD skills, then this is not the place you should waste your time


Again, Thanks for visting my GIT
